5(a)(i)  ,"1 leaf A / thick cuticle, lost the least mass / water ; 2 leaf C / thin cuticle, lost the most mass / water ; 3 leaf B / medium cuticle, lost more mass or water than A / less mass or  water than C ; 4 loss of mass is due to the loss of water ; 5 the thicker the cuticle the, less water / mass, lost ; 6 loss of, mass / water, fastest initially (then slows) ; 7 ref. to transpiration / (reduced) evaporation ; 8 data manipulation with ref. to mass ; e.g. calculation of loss  ",5  ,
5(a)(ii)  ,"less, water / mass, loss (from leaves A, B and C) ; idea of the same pattern of results as the first experiment ; reduced transpiration ; increased water (concentration) in the air ; ref. to a smaller concentration gradient ; less diffusion of water vapour ;  ",3  ,

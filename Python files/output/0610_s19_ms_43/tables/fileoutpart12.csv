4(e)  ,"tissue fluid drains (into lymphatic vessels) ; transports tissue fluid ;  back into the blood / circulatory system ; contains, lymphocytes / antibodies (in lymph nodes) ;  defence against infection / provide (active) immunity / AW ;  (lacteals) absorbs /transports, fats / fatty acids ; from small intestine / duodenum / ileum ;  AVP ;  ",3  ,
5(a)  ,"caused by a mutation ; change in, DNA / base sequence ; of gene for haemoglobin ; (causes) a different sequence of amino acids ; (so) abnormal haemoglobin produced ;  AVP ;   ",3  ,
5(b)  ,"both parents carry the, recessive allele / allele for (sickle cell) anaemia ; both parents are heterozygous ; half the gametes of both parents have the recessive allele ; people / children, who are homozygous recessive have (sickle cell) anaemia ; there is a, 0.5 × 0.5 / 0.25, chance of, being homozygous  recessive / having (sickle cell) anaemia ;  ",4  ,
5(c)(i)  ,(group of) organisms that can reproduce ; to produce fertile offspring ;  ,2  ,
5(c)(ii)  ,"people with sickle cell anaemia / heterozygotes / carriers / are resistant to, malaria / AW ; people with (homozygous) sickle cell anaemia are, less likely to  survive / die of sickle cell disease ; people who are heterozygous / have one copy of the sickle cell allele, are more likely to survive / have selective advantage ; idea that they are more likely to breed ; pass on allele for sickle cell ; so increase in frequency of sickle cell allele (in population) ; selective advantage for sickle cell only exists where, (mosquitoes carrying) malaria are present ; AVP ; ref. to evolution / adaptation to (local) conditions  ",5  ,

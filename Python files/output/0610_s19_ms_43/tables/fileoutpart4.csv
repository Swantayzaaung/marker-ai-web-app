2(b)(iii)  ,"rate (of photosynthesis) increases and, reaches a plateau / AW ; rate (of photosynthesis) increases until 1750 (a.u) /  25 µmol per m2 per s ; any comparative use of figures for rate ;  ",3  ,
2(b)(iv)  ,"light intensity is the limiting factor, at all light intensities used / AW ; because rate of photosynthesis does not level off (even at  high light intensities) ; carbon dioxide / temperature / chlorophyll / another factor, was not a limiting factor ; correct reference to (light) energy ; light is absorbed by chlorophyll ;  AVP ;   ",4   ,

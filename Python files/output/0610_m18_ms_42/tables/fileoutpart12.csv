Question  ,Answer  ,Marks  ,Guidance  
5(a)(i)  ,advantages  1 lower (dry) mass ; 2 fewer weeds / lower weed density ; 3 less competition ; 4 therefore higher yield of crop ;  disadvantages  5 more treatments ; 6 higher cost / time / effort ; 7 idea of increased environmental impact ; 8 increased health risks ;  ,4  ,
5(a)(ii)  ,increased strength of wind ; increased precipitation ; resistance ; type of weed ; AVP ;; e.g. ref. to amount / too much time between treatments  ,2  ,
5(a)(iii)  ,"1 absorbed by (broad leaved) weeds / selective for weeds ; 2 less absorption by (narrow leaved) crops ; 3 increase the growth (rate) of weeds ; 4 plant cannot produce enough, glucose / photosynthesise fast enough ; 5 weeds cannot maintain rate of growth ; 6 AVP ; e.g. falls over and can’t absorb sunlight  ",3  ,
5(b)  ,gravi / geo ; tropism ;  ,2  ,
6(a)  ,breakdown of large to small molecules ; from insoluble to soluble ;  ,2  ,
6(b)(i)  ,"test-tube 1  1 (less cloudy), slower break down of egg white solution / protein ; 2 (no HCl so) pH of the solution is too high ; ora 3 high pH denatures pepsin / enzyme ;  test-tube 2  4 hydrochloric acid causes a low pH ; 5 pepsin works best in / optimal activity, low pH / acidic conditions ;  test-tube 3  6 pepsin / enzyme, unable to break down, protein / egg white solution ; 7 boiling denatures, pepsin / enzyme ;  8 ref to enzyme-substrate complex / fewer successful collisions ; 9 high pH / boiling, changes shape of active site ;  ",5  ,
6(b)(ii)  ,as a control ; to show that pepsin is responsible for the protein digestion ; to show that hydrochloric acid does not digest the protein ;  ,2  ,
6(b)(iii)  , stomach ;  ,1  ,
6(c)  ,maltose broken down ; to glucose ; on the membranes of the epithelial lining ; (acts) in the small intestine / duodenum ;  ,3  ,
